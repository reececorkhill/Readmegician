## Description
As developers we're always creating new projects and building the projects is time consuming itself, then adding your README creation into the mix, well - you're in for a long night! That's where Readmegician's magic comes in... see what we did with the title? The motivation for this project was that we needed a quick and easy way to create a README file without having to worry about  the structure, so we created a nice and simple command line application (Wizard... Okay, we'll stop there with the puns!) to produce professional README files whenever we need to make them.
